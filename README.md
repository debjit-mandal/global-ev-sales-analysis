# Global EV Sales Analysis: 2010-2024

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of global electric vehicle (EV) sales data from 2010 to 2024. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and advanced statistical analysis.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the global EV sales trends, regional analysis, powertrain comparisons, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling. The analysis is performed using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various data science libraries.

## Contents

- `Global_EV_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis.
- `image.png`: Visualization image used in the notebook.
- `IEA Global EV Data 2024.csv`: The cleaned dataset used for analysis.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Data type conversion and filtering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics.
   - Trends over time.
   - Regional analysis.
   - Comparison between powertrains.

3. **Additional Analysis**
   - Correlation analysis.
   - Predictive modeling using Random Forest.
   - Feature importance analysis.

4. **Conclusions and Insights**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/debjit-mandal/global-ev-sales-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

```sh
cd global-ev-sales-analysis
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook Global_EV_Sales_Analysis.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Results

The notebook provides various insights, including:

- Significant increase in EV sales over the years.
- Regional disparities in EV adoption.
- BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) dominate the market share.
- Correlations between various features.
- Predictions using Random Forest with feature importance analysis.
